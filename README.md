# etcd_backup

## Problem Statement
In this project, I will backup an etcd to a file called /tmp/myback and create a namespace called cep-project2 with a network policy that allows all the Pods in the same namespace to access one another.

## Steps to Take
1. Backing up the etcd cluster data
2. Creating and verifying the namespaces
3. Generating a certificate and private key in the worker node
4. Upgrading the Kubernetes cluster with the latest version

### 1. Backing Up the ETCD Cluster Data
